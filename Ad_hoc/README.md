# Ad hoc queries.
Highly specialized queries, that is, queries created to solve a one-time problem.
Ad hoc requests are requests for you to undertake a project or a piece of work that come unexpectedly, at short notice or without planning. They may emerge as a consequence of a problem arising, unforeseen circumstances or to respond to requests from a client.
