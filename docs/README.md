## Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code:
* Issue Trackers
* Version Control (Git)
* Plain Text Markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc)
* Code Reviews
* Automated Tests
This means following the same workflows as development teams and being integrated in the product team. It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation and work together to make it as good as possible.

Generally, a Docs as Code approach gives you the following benefits:
* Writers integrate better with development teams
* Developers will often write a first draft of documentation
* You can block the merging of new features if they don’t include documentation, which incentivizes developers to write about features while they are fresh.
