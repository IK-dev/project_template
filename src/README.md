The folder that consists of the source code related to data gathering, data preparation, feature extraction, etc.

1. The src stands for source.
2. The /src folder comprises of the raw non-minified code.
3. The /src folder is used to store the file with the primary purpose of reading (and/or editing) the code.
4. The /src folder contains all the sources, i.e. the code which is required to be manipulated before it can be used.
5. Depending on the project, the /src folder may contain only the pure sources, or the non-minified versions.
6. So, the /src folder is primarily used to store the source code files before any minification.
