# Operational data store.
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_data_store)

An ODS is a database designed to integrate data from multiple sources for additional operations on the data, for reporting, controls and operational decision support. Unlike a production master data store, the data is not passed back to operational systems. It may be passed for further operations and to the data warehouse for reporting.
